# Dryrim - Drunken Swordsman

A school project for "Advanced Topics" class. My professor told me after I presented this, "Nobody has ever handed in a full videogame in the history of this college." and it is a videogame. I designed this videogame to show the class that I have an advanced understanding on my topic, which was JavaScript. The game was designed to sell Tequila for a fictitious tequila company. If you beat the game, you get 50% off a bottle of tequila. I spent 2 months on this project.

- The site showcases my knowledge of color psychology, with analogous red and orange for a dragon-fire aesthetic, with cream and grey instead of black and white to give a more eclectic modern appeal to the color scheme.
- The site showcases my ability to achieve any desired result using my knowledge of JavaScript, as the .js file is almost 3500 lines long.
- The home page on the site showcases my ability to create professional looking mockups, this mockup shows what a Dragon Julio Tequila bottle would look like if it had existed. It, in fact, has never existed at all. That's an Adobe Photoshop rendering.
- The site Showcases my storytelling ability, which is important to give backstory on your business' or your own professional history.
- The site Showcases my ability to administer quality control to JavaScript code using beta testing and ESLint. Try to find something wrong with the programming of the game, because you won't be able to.
- The site Showcases my ability to use Adobe Illustrator to design a logo for a company. Dragon Julio Tequila is a logo that I have designed.
- The site Showcases my ability to employ google-hosted fonts to make the webpage beautiful.
